      <title>Description</title>

      <para>&datapacker; is a tool to group files by size.  It is
        designed to group files such that they fill fixed-size
        containers (called "bins") using the minimum number of
        containers.  This is useful, for instance, if you want to
        archive a number of files to CD or DVD, and want to organize
        them such that you use the minimum possible number of CDs or
        DVDs.
      </para>

      <para>
        In many cases, &datapacker; executes almost instantaneously.
        Of particular note, the <literal>hardlink</literal> action
        (see OPTIONS below) can be used to effectively copy data into
        bins without having to actually copy the data at all.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        &datapacker; is a tool in the traditional Unix style; it can
        be used in pipes and call other tools.

        Here are the command-line options you may set for
        &datapacker;.  Please note that <option>-s</option> and at
        least one file (see FILE SPECIFICATION below) is mandatory.

              When reading a list of files from standard input (see
              FILE SPECIFICATION below), expect the input to be
              separated by NULL (ASCII 0) characters instead of one
              per line.  Especially useful with <command>find
                -print0</command>.

                    leave the bins and delete the original data.
                    Either approach will be workable.

                    &datapacker; will exit on either of these situations.

              Defines the output format for the bin name.  This format

              that interprets it as
              <application>printf</application>(3) would.
              This can be useful both to define the name and the
              location of your bins.  When running &datapacker; with
              certain arguments, the bin format can be taken to be a
              directory in which files in that bin are linked.  The
              default is <literal>%03d</literal>, which outputs
              integers with leading zeros to make all bin names at
              least three characters wide.

              Normally, &datapacker; uses an efficient algorithm that
              tries to rearrange files such that the number of bins
              required is minimized.  Sometimes you may instead wish
              to preserve the ordering of files at the expense of
              potentially using more bins.  In these cases, you would
              want to use this option.
            </para>
            <para>
              As an example of such a situation: perhaps you have
              taken one photo a day for several years.  You would like
              to archive these photos to CD, but you want them to be
              stored in chronological order.  You have named the files
              such that the names indicate order, so you can pass the
              file list to &datapacker; using <option>-p</option> to
              preserve the ordering in your bins.  Thus, bin 1 will
              contain the oldest files, bin 2 the second-oldest, and
              so on.  If <option>-p</option> wasn't used, you might
              use fewer CDs, but the photos would be spread out across
              all CDs without preserving your chronological order.

              Gives the size of each bin in bytes.  Suffixes such as
              "k", "m", "g", etc. may be used to indicate kilobytes,
              megabytes, gigabytes, and so forth.  Numbers such as
              <literal>1.5g</literal> are valid, and if needed, will
              be rounded to the nearest possible integer value.

              Here are the sizes of some commonly-used bins.  For each
              item, I have provided you with both the underlying
              recording capacity of the disc and a suggested value for
              <option>-s</option>.  The suggested value for
              <option>-s</option> is lower than the underlying
              capacity because there is overhead imposed by the
              filesystem stored on the disc.  You will perhaps find
              that the suggested value for <option>-s</option> is
              lower than optimal for discs that contain few large
              files, and higher than desired for discs that contain
              vast amounts of small files.

              information necessary to make a CD bootable, etc.  You

        <para>
          After the options, you must supply one or more files to
          consider for packing into bins.  Alternatively, instead of
          listing files on the command line, you may list a single
          hyphen (<literal>-</literal>), which tells &datapacker; to
          read the list of files from standard input (stdin).
        </para>
        <para>
          &datapacker; never recurses into subdirectories.  If you
          want a recursive search -- finding all files in a given
          directory and all its subdirectories -- see the second
          example in the EXAMPLES section below.  &datapacker; is
          designed to integrate with
          <application>find</application>(1) in this situation to
          let you take advantage of find's built-in powerful recursion
          and filtering features.
        </para>
        <para>
          When reading files from standard input, it is assumed that
          the list contains one distinct filename per line.  Seasoned
          POSIX veterans will recognize the inherent limitations in
          this format.  For that reason, when given
          <option>-0</option> in conjunction with the single file
          <literal>-</literal>, &datapacker; will instead expect, on
          standard input, a list of files, each one terminated by an
          ASCII NULL character.  Such a list can be easily generated
          with <application>find</application>(1) using its
          <option>-print0</option> option.

            Put all JPEG images in <literal>~/Pictures</literal>
            into bins (using hardlinks) under the pre-existing directory
            <literal>~/bins</literal>, no more than 600MB per bin:

          <para>
            Put all files in <literal>~/Pictures</literal> or any
            subdirectory thereof into 600MB bins under ~/bins, using
            hardlinking.  This is a simple example to follow if you
            simply want a recursive search of all files.
          </para>

            Find all JPEG images in <literal>~/Pictures</literal> or
            any subdirectory thereof, put them into bins (using
            hardlinks) under the pre-existing directory

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Find all JPEG images as above, put them in 4GB bins,
            but instead of putting them
            anywhere, calculate the size of each bin and display it.
          </para>
          <programlisting>
find ~/Pictures -name "*.jpg" -print0 | \
  datapacker -0 -b ~/bins/%03d -s 4g \
  '--action=exec:echo -n "$1: "; shift; du -ch "$@" | grep total' \
  -
          </programlisting>
          <para>
            This will display output like so:
          </para>
          <programlisting>
/home/jgoerzen/bins/001: 4.0G   total
/home/jgoerzen/bins/002: 4.0G   total
/home/jgoerzen/bins/003: 4.0G   total
/home/jgoerzen/bins/004: 992M   total
          </programlisting>
          <para>
            Note: the <literal>grep</literal> pattern in this example
            is simple, but will cause unexpected results if any
            matching file contains the word "total".
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Find all JPEG images as above, and generate 600MB ISO
            images of them in ~/bins.  This will generate the ISO
            images directly without ever hardlinking files into
            ~/bins.
          </para>
          <programlisting>
find ~/Pictures -name "*.jpg" -print0 | \
  datapacker -0 -b ~/bins/%03d.iso -s 4g \
  '--action=exec:BIN="$1"; shift; mkisofs -r -J -o "$BIN" "$@"' \
  -
          </programlisting>
          <para>
            You could, if you so desired, pipe this result directly
            into a DVD-burning application.  Or, you could use
            <literal>growisofs</literal> to burn a DVD+R in a single
            step.
